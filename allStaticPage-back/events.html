            <h3>January</h3>
            <p>
              The weather almost everywhere is hot, especially along the coast. It’s also dry in most areas, including on Kilimanjaro, and this dry, warm season from December into February can be an ideal time to scale the mountain. 
              <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>February</h3>
            <p>
              The weather remains hot，but in parts of the country, the rains are falling, which means green landscapes, flowers and lots of birds.<br>
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span><span class="color-black">Sauti za Busara</span><br>
              This three-day music and dance festival is centered on all things Swahili, both traditional and modern; dates and location vary.<br>
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span><span class="color-black">Wildebeest Calving Season</span><br>
              In one of nature's greatest spectacles, over 8000 wildebeest calves are born each day in the southern Serengeti, although about 40% of these will die before they are four months old.<br>
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span><span class="color-black">Orchids, Kitulo National Park</span><br>
              The blooms of orchids (over 40 species have been identified) as well as irises, geraniums and many other wildflowers carpet Kitulo Plateau in Tanzania’s Southern Highlands. It's the rainy, muddy season here, but hardy, well- equipped hikers will be rewarded.<br>
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span><span class="color-black">Kilimanjaro Marathon</span><br>
              This marathon is something to do around Kilimanjaro’s foothills, in case climbing to the mountain’s top isn’t enough; it’s held in February or March, starting and finishing in Moshi, with a half-marathon and a 5km fun run is also available.
            </p>
            <h3>March</h3>
            <p>
              The long rains are in full swing now, although it seldom rains all day or every day. Some hotels close. Those that don't often have low-season discounts and you’ll have many areas to yourself.<br>
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span><span class="color-black">Nyama Choma Festival</span><br>
              Self-described as 'the largest barbecue showcase festival in East Africa； this is the place to try (and try, and try) one of Tanzania's favorite dishes, prepared in infinite variety by master chefs. Held several times annually in Dar es Salaam
            </p>
            <h3>April</h3>
            <p>
              The rains begin to taper off in some areas, although much of the country remains wet. Green landscapes, wildflowers and birds, plus continued ow-season prices make his a delightful time to ravel, if you can avoid the mud.<br>
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span><span class="color-black">Wildebeest Migration</span><br>
              The wildebeest - until now widely scattered over the southern Serengeti and the western reaches of Ngorongoro Conservation Area - begin to form thousands-strong herds that start migrating north and west in search of food. 
            </p>
            <h3>June</h3>
            <p>
              With the ending of the rains, the air is clear and landscapes are slowly beginning to dry out. Temperatures are also considerably cooler. <br>
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span><span class="color-black"> Serengeti Wildebeest Migration </span><br>
              As the southern Serengeti dries out, vast wildebeest herds continue migrating northwestwards and cross the Grumeti River in search of food. The timing of the crossing (which lasts about a week) varies from year to year, anywhere from May to July.<br>
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span><span class="color-black"> Dar es Salaam Charity Goat Races </span><br>
              Tanzania’s answer to the Royal Ascot, but here, all proceeds go to charity. Sponsor a goat or three, and come join in the festivities. Dates vary. 
            </p>

          <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6">
            <h3>July </h3>
            <p>
              Cool, dry July marks the start of peak travel season, with higher prices (and crowds) for safaris and lodges. It's an optimal wildlife-watching month, with sparse vegetation and animals congregating at dwindling water sources.<br>
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span><span class="color-black">Festival of the Dhow Countries </span><br>
              This two-week extravaganza of dance, music, film and literature from Tanzania and other Indian Ocean countries has the Zanzibar International Film Festival as its centerpiece. It's held in early July at various locations in the Zanzibar Archipelago.<br>
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span><span class="color-black">Dry Season Wildlife Watching </span><br>
              As rivers and streams dry out, animals congregate around remaining water sources, and it’s common to see large herds of elephants and more. Katavi and Tarangire parks are particularly notable for their dry season wildlife watching in July and August.<br>
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span><span class="color-black">Mwaka Kogwa</span><br>
              This sometimes raucous four-day festival in late July marks Nairuzim (the Shirazi New Year). Festivities are best in Makunduchi on Zanzibar.
            </p>

            <h3>August </h3>
            <p>
              Dry weather continues, as does the Serengeti wildebeest migration. Wildlife watching almost everywhere is at its prime.<br>
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span><span class="color-black">Mara River Crossing</span><br>
              By August - often earlier - the wildebeest make their spectacular crossing of the Mara River into Kenya’s Masai Mara, before roaming south again in anticipation of the rains.
            </p>

            <h3>October </h3>
            <p>
              The weather is mostly dry throughout the country, with a profusion of lavender jacaranda blossoms in higher-lying owns and some rain. It's still a fine time for wildlife watching, without the crowds of July and August.<br>
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span><span class="color-black">Makuya Cultural Arts Festival </span><br>
              This two-day festival showcases traditional dances and drumming of southern Tanzania’s Makonde, Makua and Yao tribes. Dates vary, but it's usually held in September or October.<br>
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span><span class="color-black">Bagamoyo Arts Festival</span><br>
              This is a somewhat disorganized but fascinating week of traditional music, dance, drama, acrobatics, poetry reading and more, sponsored by the Bagamoyo College of Arts and featuring local and regional ensembles. Dates vary<br>
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span><span class="color-black">Ruaha Marathon</span><br>
              This marathon in and around Iringa is a good way to test your fitness and to see the Southern Highlands. There are also races for runners with disabilities. Dates vary
            </p>

            <h3>November </h3>
            <p>
              Increasing temperatures are mitigated by the arrival of mango season and by the short rains that are now falling in many areas. It’s still a pleasant travel time, before the holiday travel high season. 
            </p>

            <h3>December </h3>
            <p>
              December's holidays and hot but dry weather bring many visitors. It’s an ideal time to climb Mt Kilimanjaro and to see the wildebeest in the southern Serengeti.<br>
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span><span class="color-black">Swahili Fashion Week</span><br>
              The largest showcase for East African design, this event is held annually in December; dates vary.
