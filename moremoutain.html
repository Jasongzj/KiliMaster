            As the highest freestanding mountain in the world, Kilimanjaro located in northeastern Tanzania. It is the pride of Africans. But it has some experts predict that the glacier<br>
            s on Kilimanjaro will disappear in ten years, at that time, people will never see the snow-capped Kilimanjaro again.<br>
            Now the Mt Kilimanjaro National Park has become one of Tanzania’s most visited parks. Many people come here is all about gazing in awe at a mountain on the equator capped with snow, and to climb to the top of Africa. <br>
            A trek up Kili lures around 25,000 trekkers each year, but don’t be fooled by the number of people who climb Kilimanjaro, this is a very serious undertaking. While many thousands of trekkers reach Uhuru Peak without major difficulty, many more don’t make it because they suffer altitude sickness and other problems.

Additionally, the good operators will serve better food and have better equipment - both of which keep you healthier and stronger on the mountain.
