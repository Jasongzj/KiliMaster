            <p>
              Hamza M. Shiraz and Salim H. Chamshama were born in Moshi Town, where the famous Kilimanjaro Mountain is located. 
              <br><br>
              Hamza has worked as a porter in the tourism industry for many years and later he decided to be a guide. As for Salim, he enrolled in a Tourism College after graduated from high school.
              <br><br>
              Both of them are specialized in mountain climbing and safari. They fully understand client needs and the quality service that the local tourism demands. They are always proud of their work and the knowledge they learn from different clients. Their hard working and quality service eventually helped them to attract investment from their previous clients, which helped them to set up their own company and fulfill their dream. Having worked as a porter and a guide was a very interesting journey for them.  Although this journey is along with challenges and obstacles, with “mountain mentality”, they believe this is the new start to their dream.

            <p>
              To set up their own company is not Hamza’s ultimate goal; this is only a start to their dream. “There are a lot of people need help in Africa, economy needs to be developed, children need to be educated and women need to earn more equal rights.  I have been in this industry for 10 years since I started with being a porter.  I had a really hard time, but because of my hard work and dedication to provide quality service, I finally started my own career. I am lucky. “Ｈamza wishes that one day he can help the people in the area of Mountain Kilimanjaro. “While running my company, I hope I can do something to benefit the community, like providing more jobs, improving the equal rights in work, doing more charity . This is not a joke. It is the road we are going through. Moshi is where I been born and raised; Tanzania is the country I deeply love. I hope more people come to my country, get to know her, fall in love with her and make it better with us.” 
              <br><br>
              Salim has been interested in tourism since his childhood. He has a chance to get into the government college, which means decent work and steady income, but he gave up and insisted to turn to the tourism college, inspired of family objection. “I love mountain”, when climbing with Salim, you can always hear he says that mountain is his office. “Mountain Kilimanjaro has always been Tanzanian proud and dignity. “It is not just a mountain; it means freedom.
              <br><br>
              “Uhuru”means freedom in local language. We overcome difficulties during the mountain climbing and set our soul free eventually. “This is the meaning of climbing. I hope one day that I might have to explain to people that how important and interesting climbing Mount Kilimanjaro is.”
              <br><br>
              They believe in their dream and they are in the practice of making their dream come true. As Chinese entrepreneur Jacky Ma said，”You still need to have a dream. What if it came true?”
