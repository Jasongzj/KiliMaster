            Zanzibar Town, also called “Stone Town”, is the heart of the archipelago, and the first stop for most travelers. 
            <br><br>
            In Stone town, when you walking through its alleyways which overhanging with wooden balconies and facing from every shore of the Indian Ocean, you will easily lose yourself in centuries of history. Stone Town was host to one of the world’s last open slave markets and stories of cruelty still strike at the conscience.
            <br><br>
            With numerous islands within sight of Stone Town, some of the most popular activities are heading out on a dhow for snorkeling, island-hopping and diving. There are many islands you can visit, too.
            <br><br>
            For example, you can go to Paje, which has a wide, white beach at the junction where the coastal road north to Bwejuu and south to Jambiani joins with the road from Zanzibar Town, people can go to the seaweed center or go for diving here.
